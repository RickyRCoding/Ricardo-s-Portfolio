        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>I love creating interactive web applications with JavaScript and Vue.js. My coding journey began at
          age six when my father gave me a book on Python. I quickly got the hang of it, but the console's user
          interface soon grew boring. This inspired me to learn Dart and the Flutter framework for mobile app
          development. From there, I moved on to the basics of web development and SQL. Today, I'm skilled at
          building front-end websites using modern frameworks such as Vue, React, Next.js, and Nuxt.js.

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>My passion for music was ignited by my dad when I was eight. I began with the Royal Conservatory of Music
          (RCM) books, working diligently until I reached Level 8. Since then, I've preferred to learn songs on my
          own, driven by my personal taste in music. This self-directed approach has helped me grow in my world of
          music. Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to showcase my skills at several events, performing for talent shows, plays,
          and other school functions.</p>

        <h2>Maths</h2>
        <p>Maths has always been an important thing to keep up with. I've gone beyond what I learn in school, as my dad
          has taught me more advanced topics like algebra, geometry, and a little trigonometry. I find these subjects
          fascinating and they help me with a lot of my other interests, like coding and problem-solving.</p>

        <p>I am a fast and dedicated learner, which is clear in how I've mastered a variety of skills, from sports to
          skill toys. I've advanced my swimming abilities, perfected biking tricks, and even taught myself complex yo-yo
          and slinky manipulation tricks. My passion for taking on new challenges and my commitment to practice allows
          me to quickly develop in any new activity I pursue.</p>
