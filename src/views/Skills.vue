    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>I love creating interactive web applications with JavaScript and Vue.js. My coding journey began at age six when
      my father gave me a book on Python. I quickly got the hang of it, but the console's user interface soon grew
      boring.
      This inspired me to learn Dart and the Flutter framework for mobile app development. From there, I moved on to the
      basics of web development and SQL. Today, I'm skilled at building front-end websites using modern frameworks such
      as Vue, React, Next.js, and Nuxt.js.</p>
